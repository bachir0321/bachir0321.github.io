<div class="aboutbody">
  <p>I'm a recent college graduate who started work full-time at Procter & Gamble. I quickly realized the long hours of a corporate job make after-hours complacency and relaxation at home all too attractive. After 16 straight years of school, I decided to fill that time with what I know best: learning! What better way to halt the lethargy than to develop capability in the ever-increasingly-relevant world of web design and development?</p>

  <p>Cincy's Finest is the first culmination of my subpar web design skills. It's an always evolving project where I test out new HTML & CSS techniques through sharing my favorite bars, breweries, and distilleries with Cincinnatians and visitors alike. Any advice on the website's aesthetic, layout, content, or anything else would be much appreciated. But go easy on me!</p>
